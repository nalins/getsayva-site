### About Nalin Sharma & SAYVA Real Estate

SAYVA (seva/वेद) means selfless service in Sanskrit and it embodies our interactions with friends, family, and clients. As a multi-generational family business, our purpose is to put the needs of others above our own. As real estate agents we refer to this as a fiduciary duty. In our daily lives, we call it SAYVA.

SAYVA is an expression of compassion for others and a genuine desire to uplift those around you. Acts of SAYVA are performed for the betterment of everyone in the group. We invite you to be part of this group.

We’re not the team that sells the most homes. We focus on serving our clients at the highest level.
