Welcome to 30 Traymore Crescent a breathtaking luxury home steps from Old Mill and Humber River. No detail was overlooked in this back-to-the-bricks custom renovation completed in 2019. This spacious, light filled home, was thoughtfully designed including numerous smart home features. It is a true labour of love and must be seen to be appreciated. The stunning open concept main floor features, white oak chevron floors, a marble gas fireplace, and a sun filled chefs kitchen! With a Wolf range, Sub-Zero fridge, marble countertops and oversized south facing windows it's perfect for entertaining or enjoying dinner with the family. The second floor includes three spacious bedrooms, two full baths, and a bright office or flex space overlooking the backyard plus a convenient second laundry room!
